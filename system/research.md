# Life Hug — Research & Methodology

**Research completed:** 2026-02-25
**Sources:** StoryCorps oral history methodology, professional ghostwriting frameworks, memoir structure analysis, founder story analysis

## 1. Executive Summary

Life Hug is a rotating question engine that surfaces one question per day. The author answers via voice or text. Answers get transcribed, tagged by chapter/theme, and filed. Over time, chapters fill themselves. Periodic review identifies gaps. Milestone deliverables ship along the way.

**Key insight from research:** The best memoirs are NOT chronological timelines. They're organized around **turning points and themes**. The best founder stories follow a **problem → struggle → breakthrough** arc. Both require multiple passes: skeleton → depth → polish.

## 2. Memoir Framework

### Recommended Structure: Hybrid (Thematic + Chronological)

Pure chronology ("I was born in...") reads like a resume. Pure thematic ("Here are my lessons...") lacks narrative drive. The hybrid approach — **chronological backbone with thematic chapters** — is what makes the best memoirs work.

### What Makes a Great Chapter

Each chapter should have:
- **A central scene** (one vivid memory that anchors it)
- **A tension** (what was at stake?)
- **A turning point** (what changed?)
- **A reflection** (what does it mean now?)

### Voice & Tone Best Practices
- First person, conversational
- Honest about struggles — hardship isn't shameful, it's formative
- Show don't tell: scenes and dialogue, not summaries
- Humor where natural
- Vulnerability is the differentiator

---

## 3. Founder Story Framework

### Recommended Structure: Problem → Struggle → Breakthrough

The best founder stories follow this arc:

1. **The Problem** — What's broken in the world?
2. **The Insight** — What did the founders see that others didn't?
3. **The Bet** — The decision to go all-in
4. **The Struggle** — Everything that almost killed the company
5. **The Breakthrough** — The moment it started working
6. **The Vision** — Where it's going and why it matters

### Voice & Tone Best Practices
- First person is more compelling than third person
- More authoritative than a memoir, but still personal
- Data and market context woven into narrative
- "We saw X and realized Y" framing
- Vulnerability about hard moments makes it real

## 4. Question Design

### How Professional Interviewers Extract Stories

From StoryCorps methodology and ghostwriter practice:

1. **Open-ended, not yes/no** — "Tell me about..." not "Did you..."
2. **Sensory questions** — "What did that room look like? What could you smell?"
3. **Emotional anchors** — "How did that make you feel? What were you thinking?"
4. **Specific moments** — "Can you think of one time when..." not "Generally, what was..."
5. **Follow-up depth** — "You mentioned X — can you tell me more about that?"
6. **Contrast questions** — "How was that different from what you expected?"

### Question Categories

#### Generic Life Story (A-E)

**Category A: Origins (Childhood & Family)**
- Earliest memories, where you grew up, family dynamics
- Financial situation, moving, formative moments
- What parents taught (intentionally and not)

**Category B: Becoming (Growing Up & Finding Direction)**
- First sense of agency, first job, pivotal people
- Big risks, failures that taught lessons
- When you started thinking about your path

**Category C: Relationships & People**
- Key relationships, mentors, friendships
- How upbringing shapes how you connect
- People you've lost or lost touch with

**Category D: Purpose & Calling**
- The decision to pursue your path
- Early conversations that shaped direction
- What people said, what keeps you going

**Category E: Reflection & Wisdom**
- Life lessons, advice to younger self
- How your definition of success changed
- What you're proud of beyond work

#### Project-Specific Categories (F-J+)
These are generated during setup based on what the author wants to write about. They follow the same open-ended, sensory, emotionally-anchored question design.

## 5. Iteration Model: Fill → Deepen → Polish

### How the Rotation Works

```
Pass 1: SKELETON
  - Rotate through ALL categories
  - One question per day
  - Goal: get the raw story down for every chapter
  - Duration: ~60-80 days for first pass

Pass 2: DEPTH
  - Review what we have per chapter
  - Identify thin spots (categories with short/vague answers)
  - Ask follow-up questions to deepen specific scenes
  - Add sensory detail, dialogue, emotion
  - Duration: ~40-60 days

Pass 3: CONNECTIONS
  - Look for themes that connect across chapters
  - Ask "bridge" questions that link experiences across time
  - Weave narrative threads through the story
  - Duration: ~20-30 days

Pass 4: POLISH
  - Read chapters aloud (or use TTS)
  - Identify awkward transitions, missing context
  - Final gap-filling questions
  - Duration: ongoing
```

### Gap Detection System

After each pass, generate a **coverage report**:
- Which categories have 0-30% answers? (RED — need skeleton)
- Which categories have 30-70%? (YELLOW — need depth)
- Which categories have 70%+? (GREEN — ready for drafting)

The rotation system prioritizes RED categories, then YELLOW, then circles back to GREEN for polish.

## 6. Spotlight System

### What Spotlights Are

Spotlights are focused collections about important people or life episodes. When the same person or event keeps appearing in answers, it's worth going deeper with targeted questions.

### How Spotlights Work
- The AI watches for recurring names and themes
- When a pattern emerges, it offers to create a Spotlight
- Each Spotlight gets 5-10 targeted questions
- Spotlights rotate at lower frequency than main questions
- They produce their own deliverables: letters, profiles, short stories

### Spotlight Deliverables
- **Character profile**: Who this person is, their relationship to the author, key moments together
- **Letter**: A letter to or about this person
- **Short story**: A narrative piece centered on a specific episode
- **Essay**: A reflection on what this person or event means

---

## 7. Review Cycles

- **Weekly:** Quick coverage check — how many categories are RED/YELLOW/GREEN?
- **Monthly:** Read through recent answers, look for narrative threads and Spotlight opportunities
- **Quarterly:** Draft milestone deliverables from accumulated material

## 8. Key References

### Memoir Methodology
- **StoryCorps Great Questions** — storycorps.org/participate/great-questions/
- **Three-Act Structure** — standard narrative framework (setup, confrontation, resolution)
- **"Memoir vs Autobiography"** — memoir = a slice of life with theme; autobiography = the whole life chronologically

### Notable Memoirs (Structure Reference)
- **Educated** (Tara Westover) — hybrid chronological/thematic, poverty → education
- **Open** (Andre Agassi) — ghost-written, first person, raw honesty about contradictions
- **Kitchen Confidential** (Bourdain) — thematic chapters, vivid sensory detail
- **Born a Crime** (Trevor Noah) — chapters as standalone stories that build a larger narrative
- **The Glass Castle** (Jeannette Walls) — hardship memoir, no self-pity, just truth

### Notable Founder Stories (Structure Reference)
- **Shoe Dog** (Phil Knight / Nike) — chronological, deeply personal, vulnerable
- **The Everything Store** (Brad Stone / Amazon) — third-person, well-researched, balanced
- **Steve Jobs** (Walter Isaacson) — authorized biography, interviews with subject + everyone around
- **The Hard Thing About Hard Things** (Ben Horowitz) — thematic chapters, each a lesson from building a company

### Oral History
- **StoryCorps methodology** — open-ended questions, active listening, follow the narrative
- **Studs Terkel** — master of oral history interviews; *Working*, *Hard Times*
